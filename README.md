# Spider R&D Club - Delivery Bike Bot

## Project Overview

Welcome to the repository for the Delivery Bike Bot project by Spider R&D Club at the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli. 
This repository contains the source code, documentation, and design files related to the project. 
The project involves the design and simulation of a delivery bike for autonomous path following and traversal over various terrains. 
The objective is to achieve stable and efficient movement using control theory and sensor integration.

## Project Details

- Description:The Delivery Bike Bot project aims to design and simulate an autonomous delivery bike capable of following paths and crossing different terrains.
- Duration: August 2022 to Mat 2023

## Project Contents

The project is organized into several tasks, each contributing to the overall goal of creating a functional delivery bike. Here is a brief overview of the major tasks:

1. **Modeling of a Non-Linear System - Simple Pendulum (Task 1A and Task1B):** Initial modeling and analysis of a simple pendulum system, which serves as a basis for understanding and developing the main bike control logic.
2. **Delivery Bike Design for CoppeliaSim Simulation (Task 1C):** Design and simulation of the delivery bike in CoppeliaSim, focusing on aspects like weight distribution, stability, and cargo storage.
3. **Balancing and Control (Task 2A):** Implementation of control logic similar to an LQR controller for balancing the delivery bike and controlling its movement.
4. **Path Following (Task 2B):** Development of path-following algorithms using sensor data to ensure the bike accurately follows a specified path.
5. **Bridge Crossing (Task 2C):** Adjusting control parameters and gain matrices to enable the bike to safely cross bridges and other challenging terrains.
6. **Terrain Traversal (Task 3):** Fine-tuning control parameters for traversing various terrains, including speed bumps and bridges.
7. **3D Printing and Physical Model (Task 4):** Creation of a physical model of the bike through 3D printing and implementation of the reaction wheel for balancing.
